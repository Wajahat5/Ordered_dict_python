# Ordered_dict_python
A data structure in python that works similar to the ordered map of c++. 

Implemented using red black tree rules.
All operations (searching, inserting, deleting etc) work in o(log(n)) time complexity
Supports all functions of the traditional dictionary of python along with many new ones like kth smallest and kth largest key.
Restriction: All keys should be of the same data type (else it is meaningless to order them).
